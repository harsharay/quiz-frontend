Developed a full-stack quiz app using React. There are several screens in the user flow. Routing is done using
React-router-dom. The first screen shows the user to enter any username and validates it, if its already taken or not. Then
the user will get 5 random questions from the backend and the score will calculated once the user submits the test. The
tests taken by the user will be stored in the user database in mongo DB. There is a questions DB as well. Last page shows
the user to enter his username and check his previous results. This includes previous scores and user answers along with
correct answers for the respective questions.

Front-End: REACT JS, REACT-HOOKS, HTML5, CSS3 | Backend: Node JS, Express JS, MongoDB
